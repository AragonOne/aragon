## Section 1. Background
The Ethical DAO is an internet-based jurisdiction that provides reliable dispute resolution services and other critical infrastructure to internet-based individuals and organizations.

The Ethical DAO is governed by Ethical Network Token (ENT) holders, who supported the initial creation of the jurisdiction and now continue to guide its evolution through established governance processes.

This Agreement exists to enumerate the shared mission, values, and constraints that bind ENT holders in their collaborative effort to create value for each other and for Aragon Network subscribers.
Section 1. RFC 2119 compliance
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
